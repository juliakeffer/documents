<h2>Overview of Digital Forensics</h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Digital forensics refers to the 
 process of recovering data from digital devices, from computer hard drives 
 to mobile devices. This activity is often associated with criminal or 
 civil investigations.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Digital devices can provide many 
 different types of information that are not obvious to the casual user.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Internet data, such as cookies, 
 browsing history, downloads, and cached web pages can provide a time line 
 of user activity, even when the user clears their cache or other Internet 
 data.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><?rh-glo_start ?>Metadata<?rh-glo_end ?> 
 </span>is information assigned to a file by the program that creates or 
 modifies it. It can include when the file was created, the user who created 
 it, and the file size.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">System files and logs provide information 
 about various types of system activities, such as what programs are installed, 
 what devices are attached to the system, and the history of users who 
 logged on to the system.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Deleted files can yield information 
 that the user thought was no longer available. Operating systems do not 
 actually remove files when the user deletes them; the space is marked 
 as available for use. Until the operating system reuses the space, the 
 deleted data can be accessed with tools such as Autopsy.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Autopsy provides a graphical user 
 interface to the tools, including </span><a title="www.sleuthkit.org"

 that can automate much of the forensic analysis. Autopsy provides additional 
 features to continue analyzing the data after the automated analysis completes.</span></p>
